You can find our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/AutomaticAI/chat-gpt-clone). You can clone the repository and head to [Vercel's](https://vercel.com/login) website. Choose your log-in method, we recommend using "Continue with Github." \

Select the place where you cloned the repository, which can be in your organization or in your private account. After installing, search for "chat-gpt-clone" and click "**Import.**" After importing the repository, you'll need to import your **ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES** which are the ones you used while testing.&#x20;

```javascript
