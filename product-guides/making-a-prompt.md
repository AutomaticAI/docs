# ðŸ“ª Making a prompt

## Step 1 - Start thinking!

Now this may be hard, but you need to think before you ask! We have a lot of traffic and it may take a while to generate something so we ask that you take some time to think about your prompt before asking us!

## Step 2 - Ask away!

Here comes the fun part! You can use your well-thought prompt and ask away with AutoAI's capabilities. We'd not want to let you down, so if there's anything you'd like us to improve on you can [report](https://report.autoai.site) it to us!
