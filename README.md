> The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language, code, or images. We offer a spectrum of [models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) with different levels of power suitable for different tasks, as well as the ability to [fine-tune](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning) your own custom models. These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification.
